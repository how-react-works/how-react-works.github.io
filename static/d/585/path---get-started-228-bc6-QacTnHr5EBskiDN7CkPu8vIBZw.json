{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>\"How React Works\" is a docs website demonstrating the internal works of React(version: 16.8.4) by <a href=\"@url\">Terry Su</a>.  </p>\n<p>One of the author's favorite technology stacks is React, which long ago decided to figure out its internal implementation and use it more freely. After a long period of research, including reading all the documents on the React official website, reading relevant articles and materials, reading and debugging the React source code, I sorted them into documents and released them on the Internet. If you like this website, welcome to follow and collect. More React related content (Hooks, React Router, etc.) will be updated later.</p>\n<!--如果你也对如何实现一个迷你react感兴趣，强烈推荐[react官网教程](https://reactjs.org/docs/implementation-notes.html),-->\n<p>The site documentation will be presented as a whole, then as a partial, concise overview of the structure of all content. Notably, the document does not deal with react-native, but rather presents the principles through the more commonly used react-dom.</p>","headings":[],"fields":{"slug":"/get-started/en/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/get-started/en/","rootPath":"/","locale":"en","decoratedLocale":"en","texts":{"siteTitle":"How React Works","getStarted":"Get Started","home":{"introduction":"Get to Know How React Works Under the Hood"}},"pathname":"/get-started","categories":[{"label":"Flow","href":"/whole-flow"},{"label":"Fiber","href":"/fiber"},{"label":"The module","foldable":true,"folded":false,"items":[{"label":"JSX","href":"/jsx"},{"label":"Why setState is asynchronous","href":"/why-setstate-is-async"},{"label":"How React event system works","href":"/how-react-event-system-works"}]}]}}
